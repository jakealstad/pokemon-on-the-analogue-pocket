# introduction
pokemon games are unique due to their utilization of real-time clock, aka rtc. rtc keeps track of time while you aren't playing pokemon games, essentially it syncs in-game time with real-time. in-game events such as kurt's apricorn pokeballs, certain pokemon evolutions, berry growth, lotteries, TV shows, Secret Base battles, etc. depend on rtc. this causes complications depending on what method you're using to play pokemon games on the analogue pocket. bulbagarden has a nice [write up](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Time) on what time/rtc effects in each generation of pokemon games. generation 2 has much more dependance on rtc than generation 3, but it's important enough in both generations that i wouldn't consider playing without functional rtc.
